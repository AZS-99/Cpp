/*
 Rule of 5
 - A constructor is used whenever String() is called
 - If it's used within a defintion, its value is assigned to the variable
 - Empty constructor is used in case of declarations with no definition, or definitions with no args.
 - Constructors are used only in declarations/definitons: auto str = String("Adam")
 - Copy assignment is used only when the operator (=) is between two predefined instances: str1 = str2
