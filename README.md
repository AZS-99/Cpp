C language  is an active-oriented language, while Java is an object-oridneted one. C++ is a hybrid.

Compilation is converting the code into executable (exec), while running is executing the the exec.
Errors are the mistakes syntax/sematnics cought in compile time, preventing the conversion of code into executable. Exceptions, on the otherhand, are 
problems that occur in runtime, like trying to access an element in an array by passing an index that is bigger than the array's size.

C++ is type-safe, meaning that it traps ERRORS (mistakes cought in compile time)

C complilers are more tolerant than C++, as in C, parameters could be dropped in the fn's signature.


NAMESPACE: 
Think of it like a context to avoid naming conflicts. _Example_: 


*hi*
